            <p className='textt'>The about us page is often a reflection of the purpose and personality of the business and its owners or top employees. Finally, the page can also incorporate contact or locational information. One way to view the about us concept is as a text self-portrait or short autobiography created by a business.</p>
            <p className='textt'>The primary purpose of an about us page is to inform the reader about the company and its operations. This is a straightforward goal that nearly all businesses have to fulfill in some fashion or another. However, there are other reasons why about us pages are common fixtures on business websites. The text on these pages is a marketing tool for a business, enticing potential customers with both the history and the aspirations of a business, as well as adding a human element. Additionally, about us pages are incorporated into search-engine marketing efforts as a way to find potential customers through Web searches.</p>
            <p className='textt'>About us pages serve much the same purpose for retailers who sell less-common or unique items as well. Additionally, they allow for an in-depth explanation of what brought the ecommerce store owner to the specific market and the thought process that led to the items being created and sold.</p>
